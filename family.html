			<p>I have an amazing family.</p>
			
			<p>I have 4 brothers and 5 sisters. I'm the middle child amongst 9. My favorite of the other 8 siblings is my younger brother Andrew. I call him 'Lad'.</p>
			
			<p>I have an amazing wife named Lynda. She is such a trooper. She feeds me, washes me, dresses me.... oh right, I'm talking about my wife not my mom. She's so caring and she has the biggest heart ever.</p>
			
			<p>My mom always takes care of all of us. Whenever I'm sick of being at my home then I go to hers. She's so sweet and she's the kind of person that takes crap from so many people but doesn't get mad about it. She's quiet just like her mom before her. But once you get my mom talking she will never EVER stop. (not always a bad thing.)</p>
			
			<p>I have two Grandma's, in a sense. Well, they're sisters, and both of their husbands have died. So they live with Mom and the kids, (more like Mom lives with them). And we call both of the Grandmas Grandma.</p>
