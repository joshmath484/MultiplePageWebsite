			<p>Link. Singular and solo. I have this picture of him because I know each person has their own singular and solo mission to fullfill, just as each college studen has their own homework to complete.</p>

		  <p>The Castle. Tying back to that idea of each of us having our own mission, each of our missions are like this castle. It has many side towers that we have to destroy before ever even getting to the real problem. If we try to tackle the castle first then we'll be over run by the creatures, (assignments) int the towers.</p>

			<p>Dark Link. I believe that each of us has a dark side. Not a side in which we intentionally do evil, but a side in which we worry too much about our own needs.</p>

			<p>Demise. For any of you that have played 'The Legend of Zelda' before, you would usually associate Demise's role in the game with Ganondorf. Well, Demise is Ganondorf. He's the first Ganondorf ever and it's his power that gets passed on through each of the Ganondorfs.</p>
			
			<p>I relate to this because each of us have an enemy that we've been fighting since day 1. Throughout my life the enemy has changed and evolved. He has become more cunning. He has found the pot holes in which you most easily fall into. An enemy much like Demise that has a weapon just a strong as mine and looks completely opposite but at the same time so similar. The enemy is..... me.</p>

			<p>The Skull Kid. A boy who was once just like everyone else. He was never to grow up and never to have to worry about any responsibilities. But curiousity got the better of this boy. He stumbled in his younger years and later in life he held aloft his hand and wondered what had he become. I don't want to be this boy.</p>
